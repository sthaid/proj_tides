INTRODUCTION
==========================================

The Earth's tides are caused by the Moon's gravity. 

There is a tidal bulge on both the side of the Earth facing the Moon, and 
also on the opposite side of the Earth facing away from the Moon.

It seems that the Moon's gravity should be pulling the water towards the Moon.
This would account for the tidal bulge on the side of the Earth facing the Moon.
But, why is there also a tidal bulge on the opposite side of the Earth?

==========================================
CENTRIFUGAL FORCE
==========================================

The answer has to do with Centrifugal Force. 

We usually think of the Moon orbiting a stationary Earth. However the Moon and the
Earth are both in orbital motion around the center of mass, or barycenter.
The Earth-Moon barycenter is located at a point that lies on a line between
the Earth and the Moon. And since the Earth is much more massive than 
the Moon, the barycenter is located close to the center of the Earth.

In this diagram:
- B: is the center of mass, or barycenter
- *: is the center of the Earth
- 1: is a point on the surface of the Earth opposite the Moon
- 2: is a point on the surface of the Earth facing the Moon
- C: centrifugal force vector, direction is away from the Moon, and 
     has the same value at all locations on and within the Earth
- Mc, M1, M2: gravitational force vectors caused by the Moon's mass, at 
     these 3 locations on Earth

The center of Earth '*' is moving in a 27 day circular orbit around the
barycenter 'B'. This causes a centrifugal force 'C', that is directed away
from the Moon, and has the same magnitude and direction at all locations on 
the surface and within the Earth. Refer to the first referenced web site.

Because the Earth and Moon are in orbit, the Centrifugal Force 'C' is equal
in magnitude and opposite in direction to the Gravitational Force 'Mc'.

Since '2' is closer to the Moon than the Earth's center, the gravitational force
M2 is larger than Mc. Adding vectors M2 and C gives a small force directed towards
the Moon at point '2'.

Since '1' is further from the Moon than Earth center, the gravitational force
M1 is smaller then Mc. Adding vectors M1 and C gives a small force directed away
from the Moon at point '1'. This accounts for the tidal bulge on the side of the 
Earth opposite from the Moon.

==========================================
SIMULATION
==========================================

The tides program simulates the tidal bulges by minimizing gravitational potential energy. 
This is done by repeatedly choosing a pair of random locations on the Earth's
surface and checking if moving a small quantity of water from one location to the other
will reduce potential energy. If so, the height of the water at the two locations 
is adjusted to simulate the movement of the water.

The program produces reasonable results. 
However, I would not be surprised if there are errors.

There are many simplifying assumptions, including:
- Earth, Moon, and Sun orbits are in the x,y plane
- the Earth is not rotating on it's axis
- depending on whether the program is simulating a spherical or disk Earth, the
  Earth is either a sphere of water, or a confined disk of water
- orbits are circular
- the calculation of potential energy is reasonably correct

==========================================
CALCULATING POTENTIAL ENERGY, CONSIDERING
- SPHERICAL EARTH
- ONLY EARTH'S GRAVITY
==========================================

Let's find the equation for potential energy of a mass-of-water 'm', at 
distance 'R' from the Earth's center. Just the gravitational force of the Earth
will be considered, for now. This potential energy is the amount of energy 
needed to raise the water from the center of the Earth to distance 'R' from the center.

Definitions of values used in the following equations:
- G:  Gravitational Constant
- Me: Mass of Earth
- Re: Radius of spherical Earth (without tidal fluctuations)
- g:  gravitational acceleration at the Earth's surface (9.81 m/s/s)
- R:  distance from Earth's center to the mass-of-water
- E:  potential energy of the the mass-of-water
- m:  mass of the mass-of-water

The acceleration at the Earth surface is:

       G * Me
   g = ------
        Re^2

Imagine a tunnel through the center of the Earth, the acceleration of gravity
at distance r from Earth center is:

                       r^3
           G * ( Me * ---- )
                      Re^3
   g(r) = -------------------
                r^2
 
          G * Me    r
   g(r) = ------ * ----
           Re^2     Re

               r
   g(r) = g * ----
               Re

The amount of Energy to lift the mass-of-water from Earth'c center for distance 'R':

          R
   E = Integral  F(r) * dr
          0

          R
   E = Integral  (m * g(r)) * dr
          0

          R                r
   E = Integral  (m * g * ----) * dr
          0                Re

        1     m * g
   E = --- * ------- * R^2
        2      Re

==========================================
CALCULATING POTENTIAL ENERGY FOR THIS SIMULATION
==========================================

The equation for potential energy, from the prior section is:

        1     m * g
   E = --- * ------- * R^2
        2      Re

         or

   E ~ g * R^2

   Where:
   - g:  gravitational acceleration at the Earth's surface (9.81 m/s/s)
   - R:  distance from Earth's center to the mass-of-water

   For this simulation, 'g' is replaced with 'gt', Where:
   - gt: magnitude of the total acceleration vector at a particular
         location of the Earth's surface;
         The total acceleration vector is the sum of the following vectors:
         - Earth gravity
         - Moon gravity
         - Sun gravity
         - centrifugal acceleration due to circular motion about Earth-Moon barycenter
         - centrifugal acceleration due to circular motion about Earth-Sun barycenter

   E ~ gt * R^2

   Note: Replacing 'g' with 'gt' is a 'simplifying assumption'.


This simulation program also need to consider the thickness of the mass of water.
The equation for 'A' accounts for when the mass-of-water is further away
from Earth's center it is spread over a larger area.

   Where:
   - m:       mass of the mass-of-water
   - A:       the Earth surface area over which the mass-of-water is spread
   - delta_R: the thickness of the mass-of-water
   - p:       density of water

   m = A * delta_R * p

            R^2
   A = k * ----
           Re^2

             R^2
   m = (k * -----) * delta_R * p
            Re^2

               1
   delta_R ~ ------
              R^2

   The simulation uses a delta_R that is approximately .001 m; 
   using this equation:

                                1
   delta_R = (.0001 * Re^2) * -----
                               R^2
