INTRODUCTION
==========================================

I've known for quite some time that the tides are caused by the 
moon's gravity, and that their is a tidal bulge on both the side of the
earth facing the moon, and on the opposite side of the earth too.

It seems that the Moon's gravity should be pulling the water towards the Moon.
This would account for the tidal bulge on the side of the Earth facing the Moon.
But, why is there also a tidal bulge on the opposite side of the Earth.

==========================================
CENTRIFUGAL FORCE
==========================================

The answer has to do with Centrifugal Force. 

We think of the Moon orbiting a stationary Earth. However the Moon and the
Earth are both in orbital motion around the center of mass, or Barycenter.
The Earth-Moon Barycenter is located at a point that lies on a line between
the center of the Earth and Moon. And since the Earth is much more massive than 
the Moon, the Barycenter is located close to the center of the Earth.

In this diagram:
- B: is the center of mass, or Barycenter
- *: is the cener of the Earth
- 1: is a point on the surface of the earth opposite the Moon
- 2: is a point on the surface of the earth facing the Moon
- C: xxx
- G, G1, G2:  xxx

The center of earth '*' is moving in a 27 day circular orbit around the
barycenter 'B'. This causes a centrifugal force 'C', that is directed away
from the Moon, and has the same magnitude and direction at all locations on 
the surface and within the Earth. Refer to the first referenced web site.

Because the Earth and Moon are in orbit, the Centrifugal Force 'C' is equal
in magnitude and opposite in direction to the Gravitational Force 'G' at the
Earth's center.

Since '2' is closer to the Moon than Earth center '*', the gravitational force
G2 is larger than G. Adding vectors G2 and C gives a small force directoed towards
the moon at point '2'.

Since '1' is further from the Moon than Earth center '*', the gravitational force
G1 is smaller then G. Adding vectors G1 and C gives a small force directed away
from the moon at point '1'. This accounts for the tidal bulge on the side of the 
Earth opposite from the Moon.

==========================================
SIMULATION
==========================================

This program simulates the tidal bulges by minimizing gravitational
potential energy. This is done by repeatedly choosing a pair of random locations on the Earth's
surface and checking if moving a small quantity of water from one location to the other
will reduce potential energy. If so, the height of the water is adjusted to simulate the
movement of the water.

The program produces reasonable results; however, I would not be surprised if there
are significant errors.

There are many simplifying assumptions, including:
- earth, moon, and sun orbits are in the x,y plane
- the earth is not rotating on it's axis
- depending on whether the program is simulating a spherical or disk earth, the
  earth is either a sphere of water, or a confined disk of water
- orbits are circular
- the calculation of potential energy is done correctly

==========================================
CALCULATING POTENTIAL ENERGY, CONSIDERING
- SPHERICAL EARTH
- ONLY EARTH'S GRAVITY
==========================================

First let's find the equation for potential energy of a mass-of-water 'm', at 
distance 'R' from the Earth's center. Just the gravitational force of the Earth
will be considered (for now). This potential energy is the amount of energy 
needed to raise the water from the center of the earth for distance 'R'.

Definitions of values used in the following equations:
- G:  Gravitational Constant
- Me: Mass of Earth
- Re: Radius of spherical Earth (without tidal fluctuations)
- g:: gravitational accel at the Earth's surface (9.81 m/s/s)
- R:  distance from earth's center to the mass-of-water
- E:  potential energy of the the mass-of-water
- m:  mass of the water

The acceleration at the earth surfaceis:

       G * Me
   g = ------
        Re^2

Imagine a tunnel through the center of the earth, the accel of gravity
at distance r from earth center is:

                       r^3
           G * ( Me * ---- )
                      Re^3
   g(r) = -------------------
                r^2
 
          G * Me    r
   g(r) = ------ * ----
           Re^2     Re

               r
   g(r) = g * ----
               Re

The amount of Energy to lift the mass-of-water from earth'c center for distance 'R':

          R
   E = Integral  F(r) * dr
          0

          R
   E = Integral  (m * g(r)) * dr
          0

          R                r
   E = Integral  (m * g * ----) * dr
          0                Re

        1     m * g
   E = --- * ------- * R^2
        2      Re

We also need to consider the height of the mass of water.
The equation for 'A' is because when the mass-of-water is further away
from earth's center it needs to be spread over a larger area.
   Where:
   - m:       mass of the water
   - A:       the earth surface area over which it is spread
   - delta_R: the height of the mass-of-water
   - p:       density of water

   m = A * delta_R * p

            R^2
   A = k * ----
           Re^2

             R^2
   m = (k * ----) * delta_R * p
            Re^2

               1
   delta_R ~ ------
              R^2

   The simulation uses a delta_R that is approximately .001 m; 
   using this equation:

             (.0001 * Re^2)
   delta_R = --------------
                 R^2
